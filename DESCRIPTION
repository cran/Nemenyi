Description: Takes a matrix with samples (rows) for multiple groups (columns). Calculates Friedman-like ranks of the groups per row. Sums the ranks of each group over all samples. Calculates the pairwise difference between the summed ranks, representing the Nemenyi-value. Looks up the corresponding p-value from the studentized range (q)-distribution.
