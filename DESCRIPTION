Description: Takes a matrix with performance measures for multiple entities (columns) over multiple domains (rows). Calculates Friedman-like ranks of the entities per domain. Sums the ranks of each classifier over all domains. Calculates the pairwise difference between the summed ranks, representing the Nemenyi-value. Looks up the corresponding p-value from the studentized range (q)-distribution.
